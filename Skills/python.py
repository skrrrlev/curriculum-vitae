I've been using Python to carry out testing of physical systems in Phase One.
Additionally, I've been using it to build data pipelines for data analysis and visualisation during my MSc and BSc.

I've built everything from pip installable packages, test scripts invoking pytest for test cases and unit testing, 
to full-fledged data preperation pipelines for astronomical data.
